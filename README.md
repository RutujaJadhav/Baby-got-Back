SIDS is
Sudden infant death syndrome: the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old 
which affects 2000-3000 infants every year in US alone. 

The current baby monitor focus on the baby alone without giving much attention to the safety of the baby taking the environment into account.

One potential environmental risk is the presence of soft animals as pillows, blankets and stuffed animals too close to the baby. High temperature/polluted air is another risk which all are collectively monitored by 'Baby Got Back'.
